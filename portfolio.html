				<header>Unannounced Project (ARPG)</header>

				<p>Created the design document for a new mini-boss to be used in the game and made a document auditing the current combat system and detailed possible direction and comparisons to other games. Set up a behavior tree, combat behaviors, and abilities for the mini-boss. Used data tables to control the hit info, character data, animations, as well as the combo system. Used UE4's Environmental Query System with this character to better control and score reactions to events during combat to make combat feel more realistic.</p>

				<header>Unannounced Project (PSVR)</header>

				<p>Worked on the design team as a technical designer to create the GDD as well as prototypes and pitches for weapons, skill system, enemies, and gameplay systems. Was put in charge of the enemy team (AI, Combat Behaviors, Abilities) and worked closely alongside the art and animation teams for each enemy.</p>

				<p>Implemented behavior trees, set up behavior states, perception system, aggro management, and handled most AI related tasks for the project. Created a hit reaction and stagger system that use a hit location map to deal damage to specifics areas, light up the area for damage indication and trigger a stagger animation if applicable. Set up an armor system to modify incoming damage and to break off individual pieces once thresholds were reached.</p>

				<header>Embers of War (PC/Steam)</header>

				<p>I came on board half way through the project to help update the single player only gameplay and functionality into both multiplayer and single player. Added a new loadout system to handle player inventory, weapons, and abilities. Created a wave-based enemy spawner system that would move down set paths, spawn different groups of enemies at specified intervals, spawn enemies at set locations, and delay spawning if no available spawn space. Worked closely with the design team to implement and iterate on new features.</p>
