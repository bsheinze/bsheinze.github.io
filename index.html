		<h2 class="intro">Hello, my name is Bradley Heinze.</h2>

		<p class="about">Creating fun, rewarding, and memorable experiences is one of my primary focuses in life. One of the ways I get to do this is through my job of being a Game Designer. From early on, I was the kid that people would give the rulebook to, planned (and winged) numerous D&D campaigns, and played games for unleathy amounts of time. As I grew up, I naturally transitioned to work by myself or with friends on small game projects getting to test out different genres. Building and crafting moments, sometimes accidentally, for players and getting to see, hear, or read about their experiences is a truly addicting process.</p>

		<p class="about">Iâ€™m always trying to improve these skills by reading books, watching movies, reading screenplays, and playing games all while trying to figure out what parts, scenes, or moments trigger these kinds of experiences. I do most of these things because I want to elicit strong feelings and emotions in people, leaving them with moments worthy of their time and attention. I hope to be fortunate enough to continue this journey and eventually expand to other ways of reaching people.</p>
